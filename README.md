### Overview
In this project, we analyzed the transportability of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event model, which was fitted using Framingham data, to the extensive national NHANES dataset. We assessed this by using the Brier Score, both when individual-level data were available and when they were unavailable, through simulation.
